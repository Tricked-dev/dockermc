# Dockermc

creating docker images for minecraft mods.

## Requesting new modpacks

Just create a issue with the curseforge link and the modpack name in the title.

## Submitting new modpacks

run `deno run -A bootstrap.ts <modpackid> [jvm version (8 default)]`
then go into that folder and run `./start.sh` or make a local image and test it out that way

## View the images here

[On my DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/tricked)
